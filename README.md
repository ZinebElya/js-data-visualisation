## JAVASCRIPT DATA-VISUALISATION CHALLENGE  
####  Description :  
In this Javascript challenge, I created 3 interactive data visualisation graphics using the chart.js library. 
  1. A line chart (data in the document)  
  2. A two bars chart (data in the document) 
  3.  Remote data, in real-time, via fetch 
 

## Objectives  

- **DOM manipulation**: to insert the graph in the correct location on the page.
- **FETCH request**:  I built a callback function to process the remote data and made the real-time graph refresh in real time
- **Chart.js**: I used the library's documentation to successfully generate both inline data graphs and the "remote data" graph. 
- **Problem-solving** : design a logical solution to implement the expected result  
- **Debugging**: using the console  
- **The notion of "separation of concerns"**: even if javascript is disabled, the user experience is still satisfactory with access to data and content.
